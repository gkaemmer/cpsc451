# E-Reader Example

Developed for Prof. David Gelernter's *The Graphical User Interface* (Yale CPSC 451). Built using React/Redux.

The content of the book is deliberately hard-coded in `src/components/Root.js`, which is probably not desirable from a technical perspective. In the future, it would be better to grab the content from a database and build the tree on the fly.
